      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the National Research Council working at the United States Naval Research Laboratory. My recent research focuses on understanding tropical cyclone intensification pathways using sensitivity analysis. Currently I am exploring applications of machine learning and data assimilation to additional weather phenomena.

      <p>Outside of research, I enjoy ballroom dancing, arts and DIY projects, and spending time outside - especially when it is with her (turbulent) dog Eddy!

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>My research interests center around understanding and predicting extreme weather events. Majority of my work is on tropical cyclone intensity, understanding the pathways to the onset and continued intensification pathways. </p>

      </p>
      <p>My research dealt with tropical cyclone intensity and intensification, focusing on how small changes to initial conditions influence development through using the WRF and its adjoint. This work was completed under the advisement of Dr. Michael Morgan. As a graduate student I spent time developing a greater understanding of teaching and mentoring pedagogy as well, through the Delta Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I founded the development of the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Mentorship Program, pairing undergraduate and graduate students together to build science identity and self-efficacy to help increase a sense of belonging in undergraduates. Additionally, I co-led the development of a graduate school orientation for the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences focused on the "Hidden Curriculum," to help increase the transparency of expectations and norms in graduate school.

        </p>
       <p> For my senior honors thesis, I developed a novel forecast post-processing system for a custom WRF ensemble by integrating machine learning (e.g., adaptive learning, regression) with traditional methods like the Kalman filter to enhance forecast adaptability. 
        </p>
         <p>I additionally spent the summer of 2016 at the Penn State Climate Science REU, completing research on the impact of CERES satellite-derived radiative energy fluxes on Southern Hemisphere jet stream position and intensity using statistical analysis and composite mapping.
